# React Facts

My solution to the _Build a React Info Site_ challenge from [scrimba.com](https://scrimba.com/).

I decided to change things up a bit and use TypeScript and Tailwind CSS in my solution.

Technologies used:

- React functional components
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Google Fonts
- Git/GitHub
